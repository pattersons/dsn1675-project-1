      <p>I am a 27 year old graphic design student from Ottawa, Ontario and I am currently in my second year of studies at Algonquin College. I have always been a creative person and strive not only to think outside of the box but to live there. My creativity and inspiration have always been driven by my obsession with constantly elevating my skill sets. I couldn't have found a better industry to immerse myself in. Being able to help people bridge the gap between the message they’re trying to convey and their target audience through visually stimulating and intriguing designs is one of the most rewarding feelings I have ever felt. I’m looking forward to a bright future in my career and am excited to see where this journey takes me.</p>
